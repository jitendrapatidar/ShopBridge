# ShopBridge
"ShopBridge" is an e-commerce application. As a part of this app, you need to build functionalities that helps manage different items they would have for sale. This will require a frontend/backend  solution. As a Backend developer, you would be needing to provide a functional solution that can be  consumed by the frontend application.

Backend Requirements:
Pick a Server-Side Programming Language that you are comfortable with or interviewing for. (C# / 
Python / Java / F# MockAPI https://mockapi.io/) to implement the APIs for "ShopBridge" for 
below actions.
Create a backend solution for Product module to be used by Product Admin, and perform 
below actions:
1. Add a new item to the inventory (The item should require a name, description, and price as 
basic fields, think of additional information that would be useful along with considerations for 
validations to ensure data sanity.)

2. Modify an item in the inventory.
3. Delete an item from the inventory.
4. Lists the items in the inventory.
Use a relational (SQL Server / MSSQL / Postgres) database and any ORM you feel comfortable with Cancel changes
for any persistent data storage needs. All the functions of the backend need to be served by 
an API call and the storeâ€™s inventory should be persisted across restarts of the backend process.
1. All API calls should be asynchronous.
2. Include data validations as and when needed.
3. Exception handlings need to be present.
 
Consider this to be just an elementary starting point to get you going and is much smaller 
compared to the expanse of your knowledge! 
Please feel free to demonstrate the width and creativity of your coding with handling of 
functionalities like business validations, image processing, stock manipulation, categories, 
search etc. along with technical pieces like exception handling, pagination...
Tracking:
Please do your best to keep track of how long you spend on the implementation of each of the, this 
is for self-timing and to determine estimation accuracy.
1. Data store design
2. API and service logic
3. Unit Test Coverage
Deployment Requirements:
1. The code should be shared via GitHub, BitBucket, or SourceTree holding all relevant code.
2. Do ensure its a deployment ready code which can be published to a production server.
Great Add-on to have:
1. Simple and minimal design, you can use Nuget packages you are comfortable with.
2. Code Coverage (UNIT TESTING) of 90% (using any Code Coverage Tool 
like PyUnit, MSUnit, NUnit, XUnit etc.)
3. Clean Code Readability
4. Supporting relevant documentation (detailed steps to run with screenshots, breakdown of 
time spent on different aspects of development).
